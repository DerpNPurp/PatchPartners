Synthetic Sewing AI for Embroidery Machines

Project files are for Aptana, which is a nice IDE for javascript projects.

See the demo here https://users.csc.calpoly.edu/~amgrow/sewsynth/

Based off of the blackwork demo here: https://users.csc.calpoly.edu/~amgrow/blackworkEmbroidery/

If you have a .DST file you can verify it here (although it might be throwing errors right now?): https://users.csc.calpoly.edu/~amgrow/sewsynth/viewer/readfile.html
